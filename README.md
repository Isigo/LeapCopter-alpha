LeapCopter-alpha
================

Alpha version of LeapCopter software will be pushed here.

This is a repository to pull alpha versions of the LeapCopter software, in order to synchronize developement. It is not safe, except for devs, to download the software uploaded here. Whenever an update is made, and certified without awful bugs, it will be pushed to the main LeapCopter repository.
